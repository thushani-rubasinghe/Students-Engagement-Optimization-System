The introduction highlights the significance of student engagement in the classroom for successful learning, emphasizing various factors influencing it. Traditional methods of assessing participation face challenges in physical classrooms, leading to the exploration of technology, including AI, to monitor and enhance engagement. The focus shifts to vision-based intelligent approaches, utilizing face detection methods and emotion recognition to provide a comprehensive evaluation of student participation.

The proposed approach aims to assess student behaviors and emotions for a thorough understanding, offering instructors valuable information to refine teaching techniques. Recognizing the impact of emotions on learning, the integration of computer vision and machine learning is explored to predict emotional states and behaviors. The introduction also discusses the use of cameras for monitoring multiple students, highlighting challenges such as image quality degradation during segmentation.

To address this challenge, the suggested solution involves integrating an image upscaling component into the system to enhance resolution and clarity. This enhancement aims to provide educators with more accurate insights into student behavior, ultimately improving teaching methods and learning outcomes.
